###Questions About my Project

We have D datasets, each dataset contains 3D image data I=G(X,Y,Z) in gray scale.

R is the resolution level of a 3D image data I, it can be set from 1 to 5.

We know that gray scale image contains values form 0 to 255 for each pixel.

Each dimension X,Y,Z of image data I has seperate ranges and offsets.

T is a histogram of a data, which is table of counting the times a value appears in image datasets.

**Descriptive** <br />

* What assumptions do we need to make before analyzing our data?
* What is the meaning of three dimensions in a 3D image dataset?
* What is the resolution of a 3D image?
* The size of our datasets?
* What is the histogram of a 3D image?
* How sparse are the images (ratio of pixels with value 0 over size of the image)?

**Exploratory** <br />

* Can normalized histograms create meaningful data for the clarity brains?
* Do we need to segment the image data and how to perform segmentation?
* How does the resolution effect our project?


**Inferential** <br />

* Can clustering reveal trends about our data?
* What conditions do we need to control to make an inference?
* Is there any specific range to determine a certain brain structure?

**Predictive** <br />

* What kind of regression do we need to run?
* Given a condition, can we predict the reaction within brain structures? Or reverse?

**Causal** <br />

* What do we need to prove in order to make a causal claim?
* How does emotions or environment influence the reaction within a certain structure of the brain?

**Mechanistic** <br />

* How does a difference in gene could make a difference of reaction within brain structures, given the identical external conditions?
