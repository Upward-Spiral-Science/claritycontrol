### Whole Brain Structures from CLARITY
*Albert, Sahithi, Wei*

-------------

#### Opportunity
There is currently no cost-efficient method to analyze structural differences between brain in different states. Brains imaged using Clarity analysis might be able to point towards these structural differences. 

#### Significance
Structural differences in the brain can offer valuable information that can lead to a better understanding of the brain under different states.

####Feasibility
Clarity analysis has been documented, and while it might not yet be feasible to make exact causal claims, general trends can be noted.

####Innovation
If successful, this project will reveal the structural differences between brains in different states.
