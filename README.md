## TOC

### Assignment 1
[**``./draft/a01_summary.md``**](https://github.com/Upward-Spiral-Science/claritycontrol/blob/master/assignments/a01_summary.md)
  > Significance and Feasability analysis of my proposed project topic

### Assignment 2
[**``./draft/a02_questions.md``**](https://github.com/Upward-Spiral-Science/claritycontrol/blob/master/assignments/a02_questions.md)
  > Asking the 6 types of scientific questions about my project topic
  
IMPORTANT NOTE: Because of an Ndio bug, we were not able to get the data thus our group was severely sidetracked. This was discussed with Jovo and he gave us the data after Assignment 3 and we were told to answer the questions we made to the best of our ability and to add new questions instead of the original assignment.
### Assignment 3
[**``./draft/a03_descriptive_and_exploratory_answers.md``**](https://github.com/Upward-Spiral-Science/claritycontrol/blob/master/assignments/a03_descriptive_and_exploratory_answers.md)
  > Begin answering my descriptive and exploratory questions. Once I've answered them I will go back and revise the questions I asked - discuss those I couldn't fully answer, ask follow up questions that would be informative, etc.
  
### Assignment 4
[**``./code/a04_inferential_simulation.ipynb``**](https://github.com/Upward-Spiral-Science/claritycontrol/blob/master/assignments/a04_inferential_simulation.ipynb)
  > Formally asked inferential question about my data, and answered it on simulated data from the null model, alternate model, and real data
  
### Assignment 5
[**``./code/a05_classification_simulation.ipynb``**] (https://github.com/Upward-Spiral-Science/claritycontrol/blob/master/assignments/a05_classification_simulation.ipynb)
  > Formally asked classification question about my data, and answered it on simulated data from the alternate model, and real data

### Assignment 6
[**``./code/a06_test_assumptions.ipynb``**] (https://github.com/Upward-Spiral-Science/claritycontrol/blob/master/assignments/a06_test_assumptions.ipynb)
  > In the previous two assignments, we made assumptions about our data. Now, we will check them and see whether or not they are true, and if not, update our understanding or assumptions about our data to those which are *more* right.

### Assignment 7
[**``./draft/a07_summary_presentation.pdf``**](https://github.com/Upward-Spiral-Science/claritycontrol/blob/master/assignments/a07_summary_presentation.pdf)
  > Presentation about findings and methods used throughout the project.
  
### Assignment 8
[**``./docs/progress_report.md``**](https://github.com/Upward-Spiral-Science/claritycontrol/blob/master/Draft/progress_report.md)
  > Report stating all analysis completed to date, as well as logical next steps.
  
### Assignment 9 & 10

> Merge here because raw data preprocessing such as ROI extraction took so much time.
