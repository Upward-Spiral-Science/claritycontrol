## TOC

### Assignment 1
[**``./assignments/a01_summary.md``**](https://github.com/Upward-Spiral-Science/claritycontrol/blob/master/assignments/a01_summary.md)
  > Significance and Feasability analysis of my proposed project topic

### Assignment 2
[**``./assignments/a02_questions.md``**](https://github.com/Upward-Spiral-Science/claritycontrol/blob/master/assignments/a02_questions.md)
  > Asking the 6 types of scientific questions about my project topic
  
### Assignment 3
[**``./assignments/a03_descriptive_and_exploratory_answers.md``**](https://github.com/Upward-Spiral-Science/claritycontrol/blob/master/assignments/a03_descriptive_and_exploratory_answers.md)
  > Begin answering my descriptive and exploratory questions. Once I've answered them I will go back and revise the questions I asked - discuss those I couldn't fully answer, ask follow up questions that would be informative, etc.

[**``./draft/revised_questions.md``**](./draft/revised_questions.md)
  > Updated the questions based on our initial analysis
  
### Assignment 4
[**``./assignments/a04_inferential_simulation.ipynb``**](https://github.com/Upward-Spiral-Science/claritycontrol/blob/master/assignments/a04_inferential_simulation.ipynb)
  > Formally asked inferential question about my data, and answered it on simulated data from the null model, alternate model, and real data
  
### Assignment 5
[**``./assignments/a05_classification_simulation.ipynb``**] (https://github.com/Upward-Spiral-Science/claritycontrol/blob/master/assignments/a05_classification_simulation.ipynb)
  > Formally asked classification question about my data, and answered it on simulated data from the alternate model, and real data

### Assignment 6
[**``./assignments/a06_test_assumptions.ipynb``**] (https://github.com/Upward-Spiral-Science/claritycontrol/blob/master/assignments/a06_test_assumptions.ipynb)
  > In the previous two assignments, we made assumptions about our data. Now, we will check them and see whether or not they are true, and if not, update our understanding or assumptions about our data to those which are *more* right.

### Assignment 7
[**``./assignments/a07_summary_presentation.pdf``**](https://github.com/Upward-Spiral-Science/claritycontrol/blob/master/assignments/a07_summary_presentation.pdf)
  > Presentation about findings and methods used throughout the project.
  
### Assignment 8
[**``claritycontrol/Draft/progress_report.md``**](https://github.com/Upward-Spiral-Science/claritycontrol/blob/master/Draft/progress_report.md)
  > Report stating all analysis completed to date, as well as logical next steps.
  
### Assignment 9 & 10

> Merge here because raw data preprocessing such as ROI extraction took so much time.
